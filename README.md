# WHERE'S MY 60?

# The most simple bus-tracking webapp possible!

This one-page webapp will be designed to perform just one task: to track the current location of the Stagecoach no. 60 bus service from Warwick University to Arena Park.

Finally got the map to display with the location (plus marker) of 'a bus', but it's rarely the actual 60 bus that the user is waiting for. Need to interrogate the API data some more and refine the selection. Possibly have to dabble with location info. Don't want to though as the idea is that this webapp stays as simple and out-of-the-way as possible. Anything that bothers the user has to go, and being nagged by the device for location permission is one of the prime bothers.
